# DLSS Neural Rendering bridge for Linux/Proton

Minimal NGX/D3D12 bridge used to run a Neural Rendering stage after a game's
existing DLSS pass under Linux/Proton.

```text
Game -> NGX/D3D12 proxy -> original DLSS -> Neural Rendering -> game output
```

The proxy intercepts the relevant D3D12 NGX calls, preserves the original DLSS
path, evaluates `NVSDK_NGX_Feature_Reserved18` with the frame resources supplied
by the game, and copies the neural result back to the expected output.

## Native Linux runtime control path

The `feat/linux-shared-runtime` branch can attach the Windows NGX proxy to the
clean Linux `libdlssnr-native.so` host started by `dlssnr-proton`.

The launcher supplies `DLSSNR_NATIVE_PORT` and `DLSSNR_NATIVE_TOKEN` to the
Proton game. The proxy connects only to loopback, authenticates the session,
queries ABI/model/device information, and keeps the connection for the process
lifetime.

When that host is present, the proxy deliberately skips executing the vendor
`nvngx_dlssnr.dll` snippet in the Windows process. The Linux runtime owns and
parses the user-provided model instead.

This is currently a **control-plane milestone**. Native frame evaluation and
D3D12/VKD3D resource transfer are not advertised, and the proxy retains the
standard game output. The host capability mask is zero until an evaluation
operation is implemented.

## Included

- `src/core_proxy.cpp`: NGX forwarding proxy and DLSS/NR chaining logic.
- `src/core_proxy.def`: forwarded NGX exports.
- `src/bridge.cpp`: runtime loader for the user-supplied DLSS and NR DLLs.
- `build.sh`: Linux cross-build script using LLVM-MinGW.

No NVIDIA DLL, SDK header, CUBIN, model weight, executable, game file, capture or
log is included.

## Build

Requirements:

- a legally obtained NVIDIA DLSS/NGX SDK for its headers;
- LLVM-MinGW targeting Windows x86-64; and
- Linux with a working Proton/VKD3D D3D12 setup.

```bash
export NGX_SDK_DIR=/path/to/nvidia-dlss-sdk
export LLVM_MINGW_ROOT=/path/to/llvm-mingw
./build.sh
```

Output:

```text
build/_nvngx.dll
build/bridge-nvngx.dll
```

The user must provide compatible, legally obtained copies of:

```text
_nvngx_real.dll
nvngx_dlss_real.dll
nvngx_dlssnr.dll
```

This is an experimental interoperability proof of concept, not a universal
installer. The reserved feature and its parameter contract are not a stable
public API. Incorrect resource formats or states can cause black frames, crashes
or device loss.

A vendor-neutral Vulkan/HIP/ZLUDA `.so` that recreates the neural pipeline is a
possible follow-up, but is not implemented in this repository.
